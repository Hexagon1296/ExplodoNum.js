    <h3 id="n.exponent">Exponents</h3>
    <p>
      If you are unaware of exponents and the notation:<br>
      For whole numbers a and b, then exponents are written a<sup>b</sup> or a^b, and read "a raised to the power of b", "a to the power of b", "a to the b", or similar.<br>
      a^b is equal to a×a×...×a with b a's.<br>
      Note that a^b and b^a is not always equal. For example, 2^3 = 2×2×2 = 8, but 3^2 = 3×3 = 9.
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.repeatedexponents">Repeated exponents</h3>
    <p>
      When the exponents are stacked, such as a<sup>b<sup>c</sup></sup> or a^b^c, it is a general consensus that the exponents are calculated from top to bottom, or right to left.<br>
      2^3^4 = 2^(3^4) = 2^81 = 2.4178516392292583e+24<br>
      (2^3)^4 = 8^4 = 4096
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.tetration">Tetration</h3>
    <p>
      Revisit the definitions of multiplication and exponentiation:<br>
      \(\begin{align}a\times b&=\underset{b\;a\text{'s}}{\underbrace{a+a+\cdots+a}}\\a\text{^}b&=\underset{b\;a\text{'s}}{\underbrace{a\times a\times\cdots\times a}}\end{align}\)<br>
      We can see to extend the series of operation, which tetration achieves:<br>
      \(a\uparrow\uparrow b=\underset{b\;a\text{'s}}{\underbrace{a\text{^}a\text{^}\cdots\text{^}a}}\)<br>
      Tetration is also written as a^^b.<br>
      Remember that the exponents are solved from top.<br>
      3^^3 = 3^3^3 = 3^(3^3) = 3^27 = 7625597484987
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.hyperoperations">Hyperoperations</h3>
    <p>
      After tetration, the series can be extended such as pentation:<br>
      \(a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow b=\underset{b\;a\text{'s}}{\underbrace{a\uparrow\uparrow a\uparrow\uparrow\cdots\uparrow\uparrow a}}\)<br>
      The repeated tetrations are solved from right to left as exponents.<br>
      The number of arrows are increased as the operation become powerful. n arrows are often abbreviated as ↑<sup>n</sup> or {n}.
      In general, \(a\uparrow^{c+1}b=\underset{b\;a\text{'s}}{\underbrace{a\uparrow^ca\uparrow^c\cdots\uparrow^ca}}\)<br>
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.condenserepetitions">Condensing repetitions</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you find yourself over welmed by stuff like 10^^^10^^^10^^^10^^10^^10^10^10^328. ExplodoNum.js condenses this by counting the number of repeated operations.<br>
      If we have 10{n} repeated m times, it is condensed into (10{n})<sup>m</sup> or (10{n})^m. These are finally chained back into a number.<br>
      The number above can be condensed into (10^^^)^3 (10^^)^2 (10^)^3 328 or (10^^^)^3 (10^^)^2 e1e1e328.<br>
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.j">J</h3>
    <p>
      Using arrows, large numbers such as 10{16}(10{12})^51 (10^^^)^6 eeee104 can be easily written, and numbers not talked about here are relatively close to other numbers, thus is discarded. However, we hit a limit; the notation is strongest if we increase the n in 10{n}10 as if it were a variable. No worries, we can just put numbers with hyperoperators as the number of arrows! Well, we will get some problems. We will get something like 10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10{10^^^(10^^)^520 ee500}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10}10. It is very hard on eyes, and very large in comparison, defeating the purpose of notation numbers in the first place. It also takes a lot of space as text, and it takes so long to write it by hand. I only put this because I could make the computer repeat pieces of text set amount of times. Worst of all, to compare which number are larger, you need to count each individual layers, and that is impractical. There must be a better way to handle such large numbers, right?<br>
      Luckily, there is! Function f(x)=10{x}10 is written as Jx. This is defined as <a href="https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/User_blog:PsiCubed2/My_Letter_Notation">a part of PsiCubed2's letter notation</a>. In addition, we can treat <i>this</i> as another operation, this time unary, but we always treated 10{n}x as unary operation "10{n}", so no worries. So, we can now see the above number clearly, written J^45 10^^^(10^^)^520 ee500.

    <h3 id="n.jrepetition">Applying repetition to J</h3>
    <p>
      J is a fast growing operator. Using it, it is possible to write some really large numbers like J^183 (10{52})^31 (10{32})^7312 (10{12})^51 (10^^^^)^8 eeeee5.891341e243 easily, and not take up much space. But eventually, the powers of J will themselves become numbers with hyperoperators, and suddenly we are back to where we started when we created J.<br/>
      Well, you can fix that, too. By defining a repetition of J, just like the hyperoperators with exponentiation..<br/>
      We will define a function g(x) as the repetition of J, being 10{10{10{10{...{10}...}10}10}10}10, with x 10's from the center out.<br/>
      This may seem familiar if you know the Bowerism hyperoperators: this is actually just 10 expanded to the x, written 10{{1}}x.<br/>
      We can do the same with the hyperoperators as before. Define 10{{2}}x as 10{{1}}10{{1}}10{{1}}...{{1}}10{{1}}10 with x 10's, etc.<br/>
      In fact, we could define 10{{0}}x as Jx, to continue the pattern backwards. This isn't actually defined in the Bowerism hyperoperators, but it's helpful here.
    </p>
    <h3 id="n.m">M</h3>
    <p>
      Now we will be back to what made us create J in the first place. Eventually, we will be writing numbers like 10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{10{{(10{{20}})^2 (10{{12}})^51 (10{{2}})^5 10^^^(10^^)^520 ee500}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10}}10, which defeats the purpose again.<br/>
      You guessed it, there's a solution to that, to. Mx is defined as 10{{x}}10, and solves the above problem.<br/>
      Now you can write the above as M^33 (10{{20}})^2 (10{{12}})^51 (10{{2}})^5 10^^^(10^^)^520 ee500.
