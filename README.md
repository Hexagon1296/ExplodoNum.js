# ExplodoNum.js
A JavaScript library for handling numbers up to {10,9e15,1,3} in [BEAF](https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/BEAF).

This reaches up to f<sub>Ï‰2+1</sub> in the FGH, which is also where [explosion](https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Explosion) lies, hence the name.
A lot of the code here is from or derived from [ExpantaNum.js](https://github.com/Naruyoko/ExpantaNum.js/) by [Naruyoko](https://github.com/Naruyoko/). Now you may be asking yourself "Why didn't you just fork it?". I (30IG) have no answer to that.
